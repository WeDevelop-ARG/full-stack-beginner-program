## Contents

- Programming paradigms: Functional, OOP.
- Databases: Relational (PostgreSQL) and Non-Relational (MongoDB, Redis).
- Git.
- Agile (SCRUM).
- Testing (Unit testing, Integration testing). TDD vs BDD.
- REST.

## Resources

### Programming paradigms: Functional programming

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming. Pay special attention to the following concepts: High-order
    functions, Pure functions.

### Programming paradigms: Object-oriented programming

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.
- SOLID principles:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEnePs2Evg0&list=PLiWWZqwu9gpvoczhzPXwIPA5TP_SDVWBB.
- Duck typing:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaIxRQSAZXE.
- Dependency Inversion:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9awxA1wNNY.

### Databases

#### Relational

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database. Pay special attention to the following concepts: Relationships,
    ACID transactions, Views, Constraints, Normalization.
- PostgreSQL:
  - Philosophy: https://www.postgresql.org/about.

#### Non-relational (NoSQL)

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL.
  - https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained?jmp=footer.
- MongoDB:
  - Philosophy: https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-architecture-guide.

If you want to play with PostgreSQL and/or MongoDB, you can generate a fake set of data using the scripts from this
repo https://github.com/WeDevelop-ARG/generate-test-data and import it into your schema.

### Control version: Git
- Git tutorial by Git: https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial.

### Agile: SCRUM

- Basic theory:
  - https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101.
  - Agile manifesto: https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html.
  - SCRUM: https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum.

### Testing

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing.
- TDD (Test-Driven Development) / BDD (Behavior-Driven Development):
  - Testing, TDD, BDD, Checking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zatcvoNqSaI&list=PLrhzvIcii6GPvcDWwQ4aeFn8qWESTEbTX.
  - Integrated tests are a scam: https://vimeo.com/80533536.
- Testing + Agile = Refactoring:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring.
  
### REST

- Basic theory:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

### Wrap-up

Don't forget to ask any question you have. Also, contact Abel or Mauricio to get in touch with team members and learn how we use the things you just learned.

### Bonus

- Design patterns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc. I'd suggest watching
  only 1 video a day and dig deeper about each pattern.
- Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, by Robert C. Martin. ISBN-10: 0132350882, ISBN-13: 978-0132350884.
  This is one of the **books you must read**. Get it as soon as you can. You will love it.
- The mythical 10x programmer: http://antirez.com/news/112.
- Refactoring: Ruby Edition, by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, Martin Fowler and Kent Beck. ISBN-10: 0321984137,
  ISBN-13: 978-0321984135. There are other editions of this book using different languages. Even though refactoring applies
  for every language, I'd suggest getting the Ruby edition since it uses features from a dynamic, intepreted, and object
  oriented language, as is Ruby. This book also belongs to the list **books you must read**.
