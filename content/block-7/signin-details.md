# Signin page details

This page will be used for users to sign in to our site. This page should be shown on the route `/auth/signin`.

## Form

As in the Signup, you can use whatever tool you want to create the form.

The form must have the fields:
- username
- password

All these fields must be required.

Add a link at the bottom to a route `/auth/signup` (as shown on the mockup).

## Style

Base this page's style on this mockup:
