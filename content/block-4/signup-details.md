# Signup page details

This page will be used for users to sign up on our site. This page should be shown on the route `/auth/signup`.

## Form

Let's use whatever you want to build the form. There are a lot of options out there.

The form must have the fields:
- firstName
- lastName
- username
- password

All these fields must be required.

Add a link at the bottom to a route `/auth/signin` (as shown on the mockup).

## Style

Base this page's style on this mockup:
